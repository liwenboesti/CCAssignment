One source file for one problem.
Name files as "SolutionXX.java" - XX for 2-digit problem number.


Comments: Generally for this set of solutions (Chapter 2), creating test cases is somewhat even more time consuming than writing the algorithm code, thus I decided not to include specific test cases for each solutions in Chapter 2. However, I've found many of the CtCI questions are similar to LeetCode questions (both Chap1&2), so I've selected many of my solutions from the homework and tested on LeetCode site and I believe all of my code are running correctly when tested. Hopefully this approach is acceptable from a grader's perspective.
